# AI-VOICE-AGENT
Day 1 of 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge – Flask backend with HTML + JS frontend setup

🎤 # 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge

Welcome to my hands-on journey through the 30 Days of Voice Agents challenge organized by **Murf AI**.  
Each day, I'll be building small yet meaningful projects that combine voice technologies using tools like Flask, Javascript and AI APIs.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository documents my daily progress — starting with backend setup and leading up to more complex voice interactions using AI APIs. The goal is to **learn by doing**, while mastering tools like:

- Flask (Python micro-framework)
- JavaScript (for client-side interaction)
- HTML/CSS (UI structure & styling)
- Speech technologies (coming soon)
